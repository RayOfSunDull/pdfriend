merges the given files into one pdf. It can handle multiple pdfs, as well convert and merge png and jpg images. Glob patterns are also supported. You can specify the output filename using the -o or --outfile flag, otherwise it defaults to pdfriend_output.pdf. You can also specify the quality when images are converted to pdfs via the -q or --quality flag. It's an integer going from 0 to 100, 100 is no lossy compression and 0 is full lossy compression.

    examples:
        pdfriend merge pdf1.pdf img.png pdf2.pdf -o merged.pdf
            merges all of those into merged.pdf, preserving the quality of img.png
        pdfriend merge folder_name/* -o merged.pdf -q 50
            merges all files in directory folder_name into merged.pdf and compresses the images by 50%.
        pdfriend merge pdf1.pdf folder_name/* img.jpg pdf2.pdf -o apricot.pdf
            merges every file given, including all files in folder_name, into apricot.pdf
