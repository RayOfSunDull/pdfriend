# Simple command line PDF editor

`pdfriend` is, or rather will be, a simple command line program for editing PDF files at the page level (meaning it will be able to manipulate pages, but not the content of said pages). 

It is still under development (version 0.0.0): currently it can only merge PDF files, as well as images to PDFs. Once I complete the feature set, I'll polish the documentation and publish it to PyPI.
