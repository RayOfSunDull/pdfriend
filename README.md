# Simple command line PDF editor

`pdfriend` is a simple command line program for editing PDF files at the page level (meaning it's able to manipulate pages, but not the content of said pages). It can, among other things:

- merge many PDFs, PNGs and JPGs into a single PDF
- split a PDF into different parts
- rotate PDF pages
- delete PDF pages
- change the order of pages in a PDF
- encrypt and decrypt PDFs

## Installation
The recommended way to install `pdfriend` is through [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). Simply run:
```sh
pipx install pdfriend
```
You need a working python 3.11 or newer installation.

Alternatively, you can install it as you would any other PyPI package, for example using pip:
```sh
pip install pdfriend
```
